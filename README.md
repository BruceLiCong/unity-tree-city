# unity-tree-city
Visualize and learn about Philadelphia's street trees with Unity and Mapbox SDK.

### About
Before this demo, I had only read or heard about GIS and didn't understand it at a deeper level other than "it's about mapping." After Hurricane Harvey hit Texas, I started to learn more about how storm-based flooding becomes more prevalent with the mass removal of trees in urban areas. Out of curiosity I looked at street tree maps where I live, in Philadelphia, PA, to gauge how well gathered our data is. I wanted to visualize this data in a 3D cityscape.

### Project Setup
You'll need to first register an account at [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com) to obtain an API access key. Locate the key in the [Account page](https://www.mapbox.com/studio/account/tokens/). In Unity open the `MapBoxCity` project directory and then enter your API key in the `Mapbox > Configure` menu window and save.

This project has only been tested and created with Unity 2017. Any project issues appertaining to other versions can be flagged in the [Issues](https://github.com/ivanarellano/unity-tree-city/issues) page for this repo.

### Running
You can [try the demo online](https://games.ivanarellano.com/treecity) in a browser without an installation. A [Windows executable](https://games.ivanarellano.com/treecity/TreeCity.zip) is also available.
