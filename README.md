# unity-tree-city
Visualize and learn about Philadelphia's street trees with Unity and Mapbox SDK.

### Why?
Before this demo, I had only read or heard about GIS and didn't understand it at a deeper level other than "it's about mapping." After Hurricane Harvey hit Texas, I started to learn more about how storm-based flooding becomes more prevalent with the mass removal of trees in urban areas. Out of curiosity I looked at street tree maps where I live, in Philadelphia, PA, to gauge how well gathered our data is. I wanted to visualize this data in a 3D cityscape.
